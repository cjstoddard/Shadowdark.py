This program randomly generates a character for the Shadowdark RPG, Quickstart rules are availble at;

https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/413713/Shadowdark-RPG-Quickstart-Set

I wrote this program with Python 3.11.2, it should work fine with any 3.x version, I will probably ignore the problem if it doesn't work on versions of Python other than what I am using. You will need Python to run this program, Python is free and open software, it is availble for download at Python.org.

This is a commandline, text only program, there is no fancy Windows GUI, this will not change anytime soon. My Python skills are rusty, I wrote this in a couple of hours, with no regard for good progrraming practices, cleaning it up is on the todo list.

This is an offshoot project from a Basic program I wrote to make Shadowdark characters, which itself was an offshoot of a program I wrote in the early 90's for making D&D characters. I am no longer working on that code and I made the repository private, all further work in this area will be done on this project.

This project is not meant to be a full fledged character manager, the sole purpose of this program is to generate 1st level characters. The use cases being quick NPC generator, pregenerated characters and lazy players. I also wanted to build a simple enough code base where even someone with no Python experience can add thier own Ancestries and Classes just by looking at the code and doing a bit of copy/paste and modify work. If you are looking for a more advanced program, I suggest https://shadowdarklings.net/ or https://www.shadowdork.com/welcome-component.

Thank you to Kelsey Dionne for creating the Shadowdark RPG, your hard work and creativity is appreciated.
